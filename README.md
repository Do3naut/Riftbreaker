## Description
Play as the Artifact, a speedy anomaly able to tear open space and time. Your mission is to escape your own reality by literally running away from it. But time waits for no oneâ€¦and your fate is inevitably bound to your own reality.

## Mechanics
You cannot stop (unless you hit a wall), or voluntarily change your own direction.

Space - jump/wallhop. Wallhopping increases your speed slightly and reverses your direction. Left Shift - teleport. This warps you a short distance at the cost of your speed force. Q - bullet time. This slows down the time around you at the cost of your speed force. Right Shift - phase. When you reach a high speed (50), summon an energy blade to cut open a rift, phasing through all terrain while moving at max speed. This ability cannot be used consecutively. Right Shift while phasing to cancel prematurely.

When your speed is below a threshold, a timer (the green wheel) will start to tick down. Once the timer runs out, well, you know what happens. The wheel will recharge if you remain above the threshold.

The stage is ephemeral - moving past a certain point may cause the past terrain to shift, meaning you can traverse forwards or backwards.
