Speed


Stop moving = not stonks
Parkour off obstacles = stonks


Speed enables certain actions: attacks, wall breaking, etc.
Wall breaking warps you into a parallel reality with no obstacles
Short teleport that costs speed


Work out audio implementation (Unity native)


Lore: 
Something electric
* Kinetic energy keeps you stable, but you are running from a time loop and if you stop, you will be warped back to the start (die) 
   * Some reason that you are trying to escape your current reality.

Assets 

Jumping (whoosh sound)
Enemy defeat (fizzing out)
